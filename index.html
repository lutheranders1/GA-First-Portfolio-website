        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate Data Analyst and Full Stack Software Engineer At PSEG Long Island, our team's business 
            intelligence solutions have propelled a resolution rate to 94.1%, largely due to my proficiency in 
            Tableau and data analytics. My Master's in Systems Engineering and Statistics from the University of 
            Tennessee amplifies my ability to deliver in-depth performance analysis and actionable insights.The transition from Amazon's 
            managerial role to a focused technical path in data analytics 
            underscores a commitment to continuous learning and applying diverse skill sets. 
            Alongside my role, I maintain fluency in HTML5, further blending my technical acumen with a strong foundation in f
            ull-stack development acquired from General Assembly..</p>

                <h3>Danny's Diner SQL Case Study</h3>
                <p>Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns,
                how much money they’ve spent, andwhich menu items are their favourite.
                Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
                He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program — 
                additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL..</p>
