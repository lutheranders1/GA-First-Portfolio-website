# GA-First-Portfolio-website
My portfolio used HTMl, CSS and Javascript technologies most of the styling utilized the flex functionality of css. For my project I chose to revisit a simiple interest calculator that I previously wrote using vanilla javascript. I tried to refactor it completely using jquery but this was not working well even after consulation with a TA. I choose to refactor the code without using jquery.
